SpriteAnimator
Luca Andre Martinelli 

Sprite Animator is a tiny library I wrote a few years ago to work with 2D sprite animations in unity.
This avoids the cumbersome process of creating and setting up animations with the Animator when all that is required is are instant transitions and frame-by-frame animations.
